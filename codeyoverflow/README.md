This is a project from the Codecademy Front-End Developer Career Path (Unit 4/5).

The purpose of building this application is to sharpen skills in React components by practicing using props as well as defining, rendering, and referencing components.

Thank you for your support! 

Feel free to check in as I continue to build my developer skills.
